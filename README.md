# Amazon Warehouse Efficiency Analysis 🏭📦📊

This project explores warehouse shift performance using simulated operational data from an Amazon fulfillment center.

## 📌 Overview
- Analyzed key metrics across Day, Swing, and Graveyard shifts
- Visualized average processing time, orders fulfilled, mispick rates, and employee efficiency
- Identified underperforming shifts and recommended data-driven improvements

## 🔍 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Graveyard shift** had the lowest average processing time but the highest error rate (mispicks)
- **Swing shift** maintained strong overall performance with fewer errors
- **Orders per employee** revealed efficiency gaps across shifts

## 📈 Recommendations
- Investigate mispick root causes in Graveyard shift
- Consider balancing staffing levels across shifts for optimal output
